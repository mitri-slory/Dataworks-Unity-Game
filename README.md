# Dataworks-Unity-Game
A Unity game I developed in a group of five as the main coder in my Computational Media: Video Game Development course where the player has to use commands to slide and rotate pipes to reconnect a city's data network in the form of a puzzle game. The purpose of this game was to teach elementary school children fundamental aspects of coding. I worked on many of the scripts for this project and even created the foundation for our UI as well.
