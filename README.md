# Dataworks-Unity-Game
A Unity game I developed in a group of five as the main coder in my Computational Media: Video Game Development course to teach elementary school children fundamental aspects of coding. I typed my role on the Scripts I worked on in this project at the top of code. Also, I worked on the foundational aspects of the UI.
